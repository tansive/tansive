### Open platform for Policy-Driven, Auditable, Secure AI Agents

Tansive is a developer- and ops-friendly platform for building, executing, and governing AI agents and tools using declarative workflows and fine-grained policies. It‚Äôs not just another agent framework ‚Äî Tansive is agnostic to both agent frameworks and programming languages.

With Tansive, developers can embed agentic workflows into existing applications or build new vertical solutions on top of their data without learning new languages, complex SDKs, or frameworks.

Ops teams can run agents the same way they run APIs and services today: declaratively, securely, and with full observability and compliance.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Declarative Agent Catalog**  
  A hierarchically structured repository of agents, tools, and contextual data, partitioned across environments like dev, stage, and prod, and segmented by namespaces for teams or components.

- **Runtime Policy Enforcement**  
  Enforce fine-grained controls over access, execution, and data flows. Every invocation is checked against policy in real time.

- **Immutable Constraints and Transforms**  
  Pin runtime sessions to specific values and apply user-defined transforms to securely filter or modify inputs. Protect sensitive data like PII, PHI, and PCI. Apply runtime feature flags to tools and agents.

- **Tamper-Evident Audit Logging**  
  Hash-linked, signed logs of every action for observability, compliance, and forensic analysis.

- **Language and Framework Agnostic**  
  Author tools and agents in any language ‚Äî Python, Bash, Go, Node.js ‚Äî with no mandatory SDKs.

- **GitOps Friendly**  
  Configure everything via declarative YAML specs version-controlled in Git, modeled on familiar cloud-native patterns.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Read detailed Intallation and Getting Started walkthrough at [docs.tansive.io](https://docs.tansive.io/getting-started)

> **Note:** Tansive is currently in **0.1-alpha** and rapidly evolving. Expect rough edges ‚Äî feedback is welcome!

### Install Tansive

1. **Run the Tansive Server and Tangent**

```bash
docker compose -f scripts/docker/docker-compose-aio.yaml up -d
```

Wait for services to start. Use `--pull always` option if you have already run Tansive and need to get the latest images.

2. **Install the CLI**

Download the appropriate release binary named `tansive-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` from [Releases](https://github.com/tansive/tansive/releases) or build from source.

```bash
# Verify CLI installation
tansive version

# Configure CLI
tansive config --server https://local.tansive.dev:8678

# Login in single user mode
tansive login

# Verify status
tansive status
```

### Setup a Catalog

1. **Configure API Keys**

Configure API Keys to run the sample agents.

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI or Anthropic API Key. Replace only the API key you want to use - keep the placeholder for keys you don't need (e.g., if you only use Claude, keep `<your-openai-key-here>` as-is).

```bash
# Create the .env file
# Replace only the API keys you want to use - keep placeholders for unused keys
cat > .env << 'EOF'
CLAUDE_API_KEY="<your-claude-key-here>"
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-key-here>"
# don't modify this. you don't need a kubernetes cluster!
KUBECONFIG="YXBpVmVyc2lvbjogdjEKa2luZDogQ29uZmlnCmNsdXN0ZXJzOgogIC0gbmFtZTogbXktY2x1c3RlcgogICAgY2x1c3RlcjoKICAgICAgc2VydmVyOiBodHRwczovL2Rldi1lbnYuZXhhbXBsZS5jb20KICAgICAgY2VydGlmaWNhdG9yaXR5LWRhdGE6IDxiYXNlNjQtZW5jb2RlZC1jYS1jZXJ0Pg=="
EOF
```

2. **Setup the example Catalog via declarative scripts**

```bash
# sets up a new catalog with dev and prod variants, and SkillSets
bash examples/catalog_setup/setup.sh

# view the catalog structure that was setup
tansive tree
```

### Run the Example Agents

**Run the Ops Troubleshooter Agent (Control agent actions via scoped Policy)**

Change `model` to "gpt4o" or "claude" depending on the API Key

```bash
# Run in 'dev' environment (agent will redeploy a pod)
tansive session create /demo-skillsets/kubernetes-demo/k8s_troubleshooter \
--view dev-view \
--input-args '{"prompt":"An order-placement issue is affecting our e-commerce system. Use the provided tools to identify the root cause and take any necessary steps to resolve it.","model":"claude"}'


# Run in 'prod' environment. (policy will block redeployment)
tansive session create /demo-skillsets/kubernetes-demo/k8s_troubleshooter \
--view prod-view \
--input-args '{"prompt":"An order-placement issue is affecting our e-commerce system. Use the provided tools to identify the root cause and take any necessary steps to resolve it.","model":"claude"}'
```

**Run the Health Bot Agent (Protect sensitive PHI data via session pinning)**

```bash
# Run the Health Bot with Session pinned to John's patient_id
tansive session create /demo-skillsets/health-record-demo/health-record-agent \
--view dev-view \
--input-args '{"prompt":"John was looking sick. Can you please check his bloodwork?","model":"gpt4o"}' \
--session-vars '{"patient_id":"H12345"}'


# Try to fetch Sheila's record (expected: Tansive will reject this request)
tansive session create /demo-skillsets/health-record-demo/health-record-agent \
--view dev-view \
--input-args '{"prompt":"Sheila was looking sick. Can you please check her bloodwork?","model":"gpt4o"}' \
--session-vars '{"patient_id":"H12345"}'

```
